## Introduction

Our Lotto Platform utilizes Base Network, an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solution, to provide a secure, scalable, and cost-effective environment for decentralized lottery games. By integrating cutting-edge blockchain features and ensuring fairness through innovative mechanisms, we aim to revolutionize the lottery industry.

## Key Features

### 1. Multiple Chances at Winning

Players have multiple opportunities to win with various draws and bowls. Each participation gives players a chance to earn more and enhance their lottery experience.

### 2. XP and Future Rewards

Every participation in the lottery earns players experience points (XP). These points can be used for future rewards, creating a win-win situation where players are always gaining value.

### 3. Gelato Integration for VRF

The main reason we decided to use Gelato is that they are the only platform that has successfully integrated Verifiable Random Function (VRF) on Base. This integration ensures that our lottery draws are fair and transparent.

### 4. On-Chain and Off-Chain Advantages

Our platform combines the advantages of both on-chain and off-chain lotteries. We offer the transparency and security of blockchain technology along with the simplicity and accessibility of traditional lotteries.

### 5. Fairness and Integrity

We generated randomness ourselves through the smart contract. This workaround ensured the fairness and integrity of the draw process, but it required additional development and testing efforts.
